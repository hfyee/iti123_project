# DAHON Company R&D Strategy and Product Overview

## 1. Vision and Design Goals/Philosophy
- The company's goal was to design bicycles that could fold down into compact packages without sacrificing strength or ride quality.
- They aimed to make bicycles fit better into an urban dweller's life.
- The company targeted the mass market with bikes that are affordable, durable, and practical.
- Even as folding bikes existed, DAHON's design focus was on better ride quality, faster folds, lighter frames, and rigidity akin to full-size frames in compact forms.

## 2. Technical Achievement/Expertise
- Development of a technology called Deltech involving 16 patents that enhance bike frame stiffness and rigidity.
- Deltech uses stiff hardened steel cables strategically placed to improve frame stiffness by balancing compression and tension.
- This innovation addresses the common issue of frame flex in folding bikes, making the ride feel more solid.
- The company holds dozens of patents related to improving ride quality and bike engineering.

## 3. Development Challenges
- Overcoming frame flex issues that commonly plague folding bikes.
- Balancing compact folding size with strength and ride quality.
- Innovating beyond existing heavy and powerful electric folding bikes by creating lightweight, compact folding e-bikes.

## 4. What Makes Its Products Unique/Competitive
- Affordable, durable folding bikes designed for the mass market.
- Superior design with patented Deltech technology improving stiffness and ride quality.
- Variety of bikes including traditional folders, full-size road bikes that fold, folding tricycles with cargo boxes.
- Lightweight electric bikes like the Cave Feather (12 kg), which is significantly lighter than most competitors.

## 5. How the Company Strives to Be Innovative
- Continuous experimentation and innovation more than 40 years since founding.
- Maintaining a culture that encourages asking "What if?" and building bikes many other companies wouldn't attempt.
- Collaborative work environment with designers, engineers, and marketers sharing spaces and resources.
- A showroom filled with extensive prototypes and patented parts accessible for reference and inspiration.

## 6. Collaborations
- Licensing their technology to other brands, expanding influence in the folding bike market.
- Multiple factories indicating scaled and possibly collaborative manufacturing.
